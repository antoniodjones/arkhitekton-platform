### Example: Authentication Story Lifecycle

**1. Planning Phase:**
```
- Product Owner creates: US-AUTH-001 "User can log in with email/password"
- Acceptance criteria defined
```

**2. Test Planning:**
```
- QA Engineer creates test suite: "Authentication"
- Creates test cases:
  → TC-001: Valid login
  → TC-002: Invalid password handling
  → TC-003: Account lockout
  → TC-004: Password reset
- Links all test cases to US-AUTH-001
- Test coverage: 100% for this story
```

**3. Development:**
```
- Developer implements login feature
- Self-tests manually
- Marks story: "Ready for QA"
```

**4. Test Execution:**
```
- QA creates test run: "Sprint 23 - Auth Testing"
- Executes TC-001: PASS ✅
- Executes TC-002: FAIL ❌
  → Creates DEF-AUTH-042: "Error message not displaying"
  → Links to US-AUTH-001 and TC-002
  → Assigns to developer
- Executes TC-003: BLOCKED 🚫 (depends on TC-002)
- Executes TC-004: PASS ✅
```

**5. Defect Resolution:**
```
- Developer receives DEF-AUTH-042
- Fixes code (add error message display)
- Commits: "fix: Display error message on invalid password (DEF-AUTH-042)"
- Links commit SHA to defect
- Marks defect: Resolved
```

**6. Re-Testing:**
```
- QA re-tests TC-002: PASS ✅
- QA tests TC-003: PASS ✅ (unblocked)
- Closes DEF-AUTH-042
- Test run complete: 4/4 passed
```

**7. Story Completion:**
```
- All tests passed, all defects closed
- QA marks US-AUTH-001: Done
- Story moves to "Ready for Release"
```

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### For QA Engineers
1. **Create test cases as soon as user stories are refined** (shift-left testing)
2. **Use descriptive test case titles** that clearly state what is being tested
3. **Link every test case to at least one user story** (traceability)
4. **Execute regression tests every sprint** to catch regressions early
5. **Create defects immediately when tests fail** (don't defer documentation)
6. **Use markdown in defect descriptions** for clear, structured reporting

### For Developers
1. **Review test cases before starting development** (understand acceptance criteria)
2. **Self-test against test cases** before marking stories "Ready for QA"
3. **Include defect ID in commit messages** for automatic linking
4. **Add root cause analysis to defects** (helps prevent similar issues)
5. **Don't close defects yourself** (let QA verify fixes)

### For Product Owners
1. **Review test coverage reports monthly** (ensure quality isn't slipping)
2. **Prioritize fixing critical defects immediately** (don't defer to "later")
3. **Participate in UAT test runs** (validate business value)
4. **Use quality metrics in release decisions** (data-driven go/no-go)
5. **Celebrate quality improvements** (recognize QA team contributions)

### For QA Managers
1. **Set team coverage goals** (e.g., "80% by end of Q1")
2. **Track defect trends** (are we improving or declining?)
3. **Conduct defect triage meetings** (prioritize high-impact fixes)
4. **Invest in test automation** (reduce manual regression burden)
5. **Document quality standards** (define "done" for the team)
