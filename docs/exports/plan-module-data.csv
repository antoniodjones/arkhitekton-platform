- All required fields are validated before submission
- Clear error messages appear next to invalid fields
- Form prevents submission until all validation passes
- Server-side validation provides consistent error responses
- Validation rules match business requirements

**Gherkin Scenarios:**

```gherkin
Feature: Initiative CRUD Validation
  As a Portfolio Manager
  I want proper validation when managing initiatives
  So that only valid data enters the system

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a Portfolio Manager
    And I am on the Initiatives tab

  Scenario: Validate required fields on initiative creation
    Given I click the ""Add Initiative"" button
    When I try to submit the form without filling required fields
    Then I should see validation errors for:
      | field | message |
      | name  | Initiative name is required |
    And the form should not be submitted
    And focus should move to the first invalid field

  Scenario: Validate budget is a positive number
    Given I am creating a new initiative
    When I enter ""-50000"" in the budget field
    And I try to submit the form
    Then I should see an error ""Budget must be a positive number""
    And the budget field should be highlighted in red

  Scenario: Validate date range consistency
    Given I am creating a new initiative
    When I set the start date to ""2025-06-01""
    And I set the target date to ""2025-01-01""
    And I try to submit the form
    Then I should see an error ""Target date must be after start date""

  Scenario: Handle server-side validation errors gracefully
    Given I am creating a new initiative with valid data
    When the server returns a validation error for duplicate name
    Then I should see a toast notification with the error message
    And the form should remain open with data preserved
    And the name field should be highlighted

  Scenario: Successfully create initiative with all valid data
    Given I fill in all required fields with valid data:
      | field | value |
      | name | Digital Transformation 2025 |
      | type | digital_transformation |
      | priority | high |

  As a Risk Manager
  I want AI risk scoring
  So that I focus on highest risks

  Background:
    Given the portfolio has 15 active initiatives

  Scenario: View portfolio risk scores
    When I navigate to Risk Dashboard
    Then I should see initiatives ranked by risk:
      | initiative | risk score | trend |
      | Legacy Migration | 85 | ↑ |
      | Cloud Migration | 62 | → |
      | CX Modernization | 35 | ↓ |

  Scenario: View risk score factors
    When I click on ""Legacy Migration""
    Then I should see factor breakdown:
      | factor | weight | score |
      | Complexity | 25% | 90 |
      | Resource Risk | 20% | 80 |
      | Technical Risk | 30% | 85 |
      | Timeline Risk | 25% | 80 |

  Scenario: Predict future risk
    Given current risk score is 62
    When I view 30-day prediction
    Then I should see:
      | prediction | risk score | confidence |
      | 30 days | 72 | 75% |
    And factors driving the increase

  Scenario: Compare initiatives
    When I select 3 initiatives to compare
    Then I should see risk scores side by side
    And identify which factors differ most

  Scenario: Track prediction accuracy
    When I view AI performance
    Then I should see:
      | metric | value |
      | Predictions made | 200 |
      | Within 10% accuracy | 85% |
      | Average error | 8 points |
